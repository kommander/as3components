For now there is just the URLImage Class, which I used in many projects over the time.


URLImage
This class provides basic functionality to load an Image from an URL and add it to the stage,
before it is loaded. The whole loading process is managed by the class.
It also includes a cache for loaded images and a loading queue,
which manages all URLImages in a project.

Example:
var image:URLImage = new URLImage('http://github.com/images/modules/header/logov3-hover.png');
addChild(image);
